The purpose of any exercise is to steadily develop skills and to acquire 
the automatic algorithms for fulfilling certain operations.  
As for the SQL language, practical exercises are intended to enable 
the database programmer to quickly devise SQL queries in order to solve 
practically any problem, by having already studied similar problems 
in exercises.  
These exercises are given from the wikibook 
[SQL Exercises](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/SQL_Exercises).  
That wiki-book provides such a collection of practical solved SQL exercises.  

For an introduction to the SQL language, please refer to the wikibook
